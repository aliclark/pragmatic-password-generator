# pragmatic-password-generator

Generates sensible, secure passwords for everyday use.

```sh
$ ./ppg.py

```

The length of the password is calculated using public data based on the performance and pricing of GPU password cracking, making sure it's prohibitively expensive to crack your password at today's prices.

The password format ensures an uppercase letter, digit, and symbol are present.
The rest of the characters are lowercase to make them easy to type on mobile.
